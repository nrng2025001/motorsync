     ↓              ↓            ↓              ↓
 handleLogin()  login()    signIn()    signInWithEmailAndPassword()
```

## ❌ ROOT CAUSE OF "INVALID CREDENTIALS" ERROR

After thorough analysis, the issue is **NOT in your code**. The error `auth/invalid-credential` means:

### **The user `advisor@test.com` does NOT exist in Firebase Authentication**

Your app code is working perfectly. The problem is that Firebase doesn't recognize the credentials because the user account hasn't been created yet.

---

## 🔧 THE SOLUTION (Step-by-Step)

### **You need to create the user in Firebase Console:**

1. **Open Firebase Console**
   ```
   https://console.firebase.google.com/
   ```

2. **Select Your Project**
   - Look for: **car-dealership-app-9f2d5**
   - Click on it

3. **Go to Authentication**
   - In the left sidebar, click **"Authentication"**
   - Click the **"Users"** tab at the top

4. **Add the Test User**
   - Click the **"Add user"** button
   - Email: `advisor@test.com`
   - Password: `TestPass123!`
   - Click **"Add user"**

5. **Verify User Created**
   - You should see the user listed
   - Check that email is exactly: `advisor@test.com`

6. **Test Login**
   - Restart your app
   - Login with: `advisor@test.com` / `TestPass123!`
   - Should work! ✅
