## 🧪 Backend Connection Test Results

```
✅ Backend is reachable!
✅ Health Check: SUCCESS (200)
📦 Response: {"status":"ok","message":"Backend running 🚀"...}

Tested 6 endpoints:
  ✅ Health Check - SUCCESS
  ⚠️  Create Test User - 500 (database issue on backend)
  ⚠️  List Enquiries - 401 (auth required - expected)
  ⚠️  List Bookings - 401 (auth required - expected)
  ⚠️  Get Stock - 401 (auth required - expected)
  ⚠️  Get Quotations - 401 (auth required - expected)
```

**Note:** The 401 errors are expected - they require Firebase authentication, which will work when you login through the app.

---

## 📱 How to Use

### 1. App is Starting
The Metro bundler and Android build are currently running in the background.

### 2. Once App Opens

Look for the **Test** tab (🧪 flask icon) in the bottom navigation:

```
[Dashboard] [Enquiries] [Generator] [🧪 Test] [Profile]
```

### 3. Test Your Backend

1. Tap on the **"Test"** tab
2. You'll see:
   - Current configuration (API URL, Backend URL, Environment)
   - A big **"Run All Tests"** button
3. Tap **"Run All Tests"**
4. Watch as it tests all endpoints in real-time
5. See color-coded results:
   - 🟢 Green = Success
   - 🔴 Red = Error
   - 🟡 Yellow = Pending

## 🎯 Test Results You Should See

### Initial Tests (Without Login):
```
✅ Health Check - Backend is up and running
⚠️  Other endpoints - 401 Unauthorized (expected, need login)
```

### After Login:
```
✅ Health Check - SUCCESS
✅ Get Enquiries Stats - SUCCESS
✅ List Enquiries - SUCCESS  
✅ Get Bookings Stats - SUCCESS
✅ List Bookings - SUCCESS
✅ Get Quotations Stats - SUCCESS
✅ List Stock - SUCCESS
```

```

### Check Network
```bash
# Ping the backend
ping 10.69.245.247

# Should respond if on same network
```

### Check App Logs

```
📋 App Configuration:
  Environment: development
  API URL: http://10.69.245.247:4000/api
  Debug Mode: true
```

### Restart App
If needed:
```bash
# Stop current processes (Ctrl+C)
npm start -- --reset-cache
npm run android
```
