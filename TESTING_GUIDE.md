# ðŸ§ª Complete Integration Testing Guide

This guide will help you test that your React Native app is working seamlessly with Firebase and your backend.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Test Results Summary**

### âœ… **What's Working:**
- **Backend Connection**: âœ… Running perfectly on port 4000
- **Firebase Configuration**: âœ… Fully configured and initialized
- **API Endpoints**: âœ… All protected endpoints correctly require authentication
- **Environment Variables**: âœ… All Firebase credentials loaded

### ðŸ“± **How to Test Your App**

## **Step 1: Start Your Expo App**

```bash
npx expo start
```

This will start your React Native app. You can run it on:
- **iOS Simulator** (if on Mac)
- **Android Emulator** 
- **Physical device** (using Expo Go app)

## **Step 2: Test Authentication Flow**

### **2.1 Test User Sign Up**
1. Open your app
2. Navigate to the sign-up screen
3. Create a new user with:
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `test123456`
   - Name: `Test User`
4. **Expected Result**: User should be created in Firebase and backend

### **2.2 Test User Sign In**
1. Use the credentials from sign-up
2. Sign in to your app
3. **Expected Result**: User should be authenticated and redirected to main app

### **2.3 Test User Profile Sync**
1. After signing in, check if user profile is synced with backend
2. **Expected Result**: User data should be available in your backend

## **Step 3: Test API Integration**

### **3.1 Test Enquiries API**
1. Navigate to Enquiries screen
2. Try to create a new enquiry
3. **Expected Result**: Enquiry should be created in your backend

### **3.2 Test Bookings API**
1. Navigate to Bookings screen
2. Try to create a new booking
3. **Expected Result**: Booking should be created in your backend

### **3.3 Test Quotations API**
1. Navigate to Quotations screen
2. Try to create a new quotation
3. **Expected Result**: Quotation should be created in your backend

## **Step 4: Test Error Handling**

### **4.1 Test Network Errors**
1. Turn off your internet connection
2. Try to perform API operations
3. **Expected Result**: App should show appropriate error messages

### **4.2 Test Authentication Errors**
1. Sign out of your app
2. Try to access protected screens
3. **Expected Result**: App should redirect to login screen

## **Step 5: Test Real-time Features**

### **5.1 Test User State Management**
1. Sign in with different users
2. Check if user roles are properly applied
3. **Expected Result**: Different users should see appropriate content based on their roles

### **5.2 Test Data Persistence**
1. Create some data (enquiries, bookings)
2. Close and reopen the app
3. **Expected Result**: Data should persist and be loaded from backend

## **Step 6: Test Backend Integration**

### **6.1 Verify Backend Logs**
1. Check your backend console logs
2. **Expected Result**: You should see API requests from your app

### **6.2 Test Database Updates**
1. Create data in your app
2. Check your backend database
3. **Expected Result**: Data should be stored in your database

## **Step 7: Test Firebase Console**

### **7.1 Check Firebase Authentication**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Navigate to Authentication â†’ Users
3. **Expected Result**: You should see users created from your app

### **7.2 Check Firebase Analytics**
1. Go to Firebase Console â†’ Analytics
2. **Expected Result**: You should see app usage data

## **ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Issue 1: "Firebase not initialized"**
**Solution**: Check your `.env` file has correct Firebase configuration

### **Issue 2: "Network request failed"**
**Solution**: Ensure your backend is running on port 4000

### **Issue 3: "Authentication failed"**
**Solution**: Check Firebase Console for authentication errors

### **Issue 4: "API endpoint not found"**
**Solution**: Verify your backend has the required endpoints

## **ðŸ“Š Test Checklist**

- [ ] App starts without errors
- [ ] User can sign up
- [ ] User can sign in
- [ ] User profile syncs with backend
- [ ] Enquiries can be created
- [ ] Bookings can be created
- [ ] Quotations can be created
- [ ] Error handling works
- [ ] User roles are applied correctly
- [ ] Data persists across app restarts
- [ ] Backend receives API requests
- [ ] Firebase Console shows users

## **ðŸŽ‰ Success Criteria**

Your integration is working seamlessly if:
1. âœ… All API operations work without errors
2. âœ… User authentication flows smoothly
3. âœ… Data is properly synced between app and backend
4. âœ… Error handling provides good user experience
5. âœ… App performance is smooth and responsive

## **ðŸ“± Quick Test Commands**

```bash
# Test backend connection
node test-backend-connection.js

# Test Firebase configuration
node test-firebase-connection.js

# Test complete integration
node test-complete-integration.js
```

## **ðŸš€ Next Steps After Testing**

Once all tests pass:
1. **Deploy your backend** to a production environment
2. **Update environment variables** for production
3. **Test with real users** and gather feedback
4. **Monitor performance** and fix any issues
5. **Add more features** based on user needs
